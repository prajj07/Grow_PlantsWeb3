# Plant Care Contract

This is a smart contract for Plant Care management. The contract is designed to provide a platform for monitoring and tracking the growth of a plant. It allows users to record information about their plants and keep track of various interactions such as watering, fertilizing, and pruning.

## Features:
•Record plant information such as plant ID, type, height, width, color, date planted, number of leaves produced, temperature, light level, humidity, and growth rate.
•Keep track of watering, fertilizing, and pruning interactions by recording the timestamp of each interaction.
•Award rewards for good plant care.
•Keep track of rewards earned.
•Store user and plant information such as user address, username, and location.


## Usage:
The contract can be used by deploying it on the Ethereum network using a tool such as Remix. Once the contract is deployed, users can interact with it using their Ethereum wallet. The following are the functions available for interaction:

• 'recordPlantInformation': This function allows users to record information about their plants.
